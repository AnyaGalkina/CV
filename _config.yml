  Hi, my name's Anna and I'm an experienced front-end developer (React/Redux stack) since Oct 2021. Also, I'm very interested in React Native.
  I'm result-oriented, well-organized and responsible team-player. Highly ambitious and extremely motivated.
  I'm so passionate about front-end development. 
  
  Before entry into IT, I had a huge working experience at worldwide known international companies such as Procter & Gamble and Avon. 
  Growing from department assistance to brand manager worked in marketing including day-to-day communication with external and internal business partners in English.
  I developed and implemented annual brand and pricing strategies identifying product gaps and incremental opportunities for growth.
  Led launch and leverage of new brands and products with 360 activation with digital and field support, based on consumer insights, needs, and marketing trends.
